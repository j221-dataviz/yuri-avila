#Project Pitch Assignment


# yuri-avila

**Goal**: To visualize how pro-choice organizations in Mexico fund their clinics against abortions. 

**Context:**

Abortion in Mexico City has been decriminalized since 2007. Now, there are 13 public clinics and more than 60 private clinics where women can terminate legally their pregnancy. At the same time, the catholic groups against abortion have grown considerably in the last years and have created strategies to convince women not to have abortions.

Centro de Ayuda para la Mujer Latinoamericana (CAM) is an organization that has created fake abortion clinics around the city in order to get the attention of women that decided to terminate their pregnancy. Instead of performing an abortion, as they announce, they try to convince them to keep the baby, making them feel guilty and giving them false medical information. Throughout the years, CAM has received money from different sources: local and federal agencies in Mexico, donations from Heartbeat and Human Life International

**Questions I would like to adress:**

* How much money has CAM received from 2007-2020? 
* Where does the money come from? 
* How is this money being assigned? (through donations, local government budget, contracts for a particular service)
* How much has this income increased over the years? 

**Sources:**

To get the information I will submit multiple transparency requests to state and federal agencies, check the donations and tax statements that CAM declares to the Mexican Tax Revenue Office, and the tax declarations of Heartbeat and Human Life International.

**Visualizations I would like to have**:

* A treemap showing the total amount of money that CAM has received by each donor. 
* A line chart showing how the income that CAM receives has increased over time.
* An interactive map showing the location of the cities that donated money and how much have donated. 
* To give a sense of the political spectrum, I would like to create a map showing the party in power in each state that donated money to the pro-life organizations and the percentage of votes that received in the last election.
