### Abortion clinics in Mexico City
*By Yuriria Avila*

The purpose of this project is to create a tool that women can use if they decide to have an abortion in Mexico City. 

I mapped 14 public clinics and 46 private clinics in Mexico City.

I created a filter for public and private clinics.

Public clinics are shown in white and private clinics are shown in a gradient color palette of yellow, green, or purple. The closer the clinics are to a metro station, the more yellow they will show, and the further, the more purple. 

 For the private clinics I added a tooltip to show the closest metro station and the approximate time it would take the user to get there by walking.

For the public clinics, I added a tooltip with the number of abortions performed since 2007 when abortion was legalized. Iâ€™m assuming that the higher the number of abortions, the higher capacity of the hospitals to perform abortions.
