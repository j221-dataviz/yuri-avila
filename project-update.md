##Project update

For my project I created a map  with the location of public abortion clinics in Mexico City. The link of the map is here: https://layurs.github.io/map1-abortions/? 

For the final project, I would like to include the 60 private clinics in Mexico City and use a different color to distinguish the public ones from the private ones. 

I explored other data related to abortion in Mexico available, created a database and cleaned it. The data shows the city of origin of women that have had an abortion since 2007 until 2019. 


I would also like to create an animated bart chart showing the change in abortion rate over the years  by state of origin. 

I would like to create a scatter plots showing the correlation between abortions in Mexico City by state of origin, and the distance in km from the state to Mexico City. My hypothesis is that the closer the state, the more likely women will go to Mexico City to have an abortion.
 

I would like to do a chord chart showing in which states is abortion legal and under which circumstances. 

**Problems and obstacles**

When I created the map with the 13 public abortion clinics, I obtained the lat and long one by one from Google Maps. However, because I aim to include 60 clinics, I will need to use Open Refine. I would need help with that. 

I would also would like to discuss whether a bar chart is the best option to compare the growth of abortion rate in 32 states.I would need some orientation on how to create the gg animate.
